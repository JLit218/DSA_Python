# LIFO - Last in, first out. You cant get to the bottom, you have to remove the previous push first
# only want to push and pop from the top of the stack as this is O(1). poping or pushing from the bottom requires indexing O(n) which is inefficient
# Think of the linked lists visual, but stacked vertically (Tennis ball container reference)
