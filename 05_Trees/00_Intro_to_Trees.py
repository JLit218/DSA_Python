# Trees: Linked lists that fork
# standard tree is binary, but the trunk can point to an infinite number of nodes

# Full Tree(in binary tree): Every node points to 0 nodes, or two nodes
# Perfect Tree: all nodes point to either none or full
# Complete Tree: nodes are filled in from left to right.
# parent: top node
# child: lower node
# Siblings: that share the same parent node
# Leaf: child node with no children
